Given observed $Y$ and a trained model, one can first predict $\hat{x}_{t+1}$ on the latent temporal factor matrix $X$ and then estimate time series data at $t+1$ with $y_{i,t+1}\approx w_i^T\hat{x}_{t+1}$





### Long Sequence Transformer: Problems Reasons Solutions

Problem: Time & Space cost. $\rightarrow$ leading to a plethora of solutions such as parameter sharing, pruning, mixed-precision, and knowledge distillation.  

Recently, researchers have directly addressed the Transformerâ€™s limitation by designing lower-complexity alternatives such as the **Longformer, Reformer, Linformer, and Performer.** However, due to the wide range of solutions, it has become challenging for the deep learning community to determine which methods to apply in practice to meet the desired trade-off between capacity, computation, and memory.
